# Keycloak (Quarkus)  Phone Provider
![Build Status](https://github.com/cooperlyt/keycloak-phone-provider/actions/workflows/compile-and-liveness-check.yml/badge.svg)

 + Phone support like e-mail
 + One Time Password (OTP) by phone
 + Login by phone
 + Register with phone
 + Authentication by phone
 + Reset password by phone

sms
voice
phone one key login

With this provider you can **enforce authentication policies based on a verification token sent to users' mobile phones**.
Currently, there are implementations for:

+ Aliyun
+ AWS SNS
+ Cloopen
+ Tencent
+ TotalVoice
+ Twilio,
+ YunTongXun SMS

More services can be added with ease due to the modularity of the code.  In fact, nothing would stop you from implementing a
sender of TTS calls or WhatsApp messages.

This is what you can do for now:
  + Check ownership of a phone number (Forms and Rest API)
  + Use SMS as second factor in 2FA method (Browser flow)
  + Login by phone (Browser flow)
  + Reset Password by phone
  + Authentication by phone (Rest API)
  + Authenticate everybody by phone, auto create user on Grant (Rest API)
  + Register with phone
  + Register only phone (username is phone number)
  + Register add user attribute with `redirect_uri` params


## Compatibility

This was initially developed using 20.0.1 version of Quarkus Keycloak as baseline.  Wildfily keycloak is not supported
anymore and I did not test user storage beyond Kerberos or LDAP. I may try to help you but I cannot guarantee.

## Usage

### **Installing:**

+ Docker
  1. docker image is [coopersoft/keycloak:21.0.1_phone-2.2.2](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/coopersoft/keycloak)
  2. for examples  [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cooper-lyt/keycloak-phone-provider/master/examples/docker-compose.yml)
  3. run as `docker-compose up` , [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is required!

If you want to build the project, simply run  `examples/docker-build.sh` after cloning the repository.
 2.2.1 is build on JAVA 17, Maven 3.8.6

  + `keycloak-phone-provide`  
    main
    
  + `keycloak-phone-provide.resources`  
    theme

  + `keycloak-sms-provider-dummy`  
    test message will print to console.

    For sms service provider, choose one of:  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-aws-sns`  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-totalvoice`  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-twilio`  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-cloopen`  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-yunxin`  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-aliyun`  
    `keycloak-sms-provider-tencent`  

+ Local
  1. local keycloak installed: copy the `target\providers` to keycloak home directory
  2. kc.[sh|bat] build
  3. Start Keycloak.

+ Cli params
```shell
  kc.[sh|bat] start \
    --spi-phone-default-service=[dummy|aws|aliyun|cloopen| ...]  # Which sms provider
    --spi-phone-default-token-expires-in=60  # sms expires ,default 60 second
    --spi-phone-default-hour-maximum=3 # How many send sms count in one hour.
    --spi-phone-default-[$realm-]duplicate-phone=false # allow one phone register multi user
    --spi-phone-default-[$realm-]number-regx=^\+?\d+$

    ...  # provider param refer provider`s readme.md
```

### **Theme**

You will need to change the realm login theme to `phone`.

You can create a customized theme base on `phone`.

```
  parent=phone
```

### **Phone registration support**

Under `Authentication` > `Flows`:

+ Copy the `Registration` flow to `Registration with phone` flow through the menu button on the right of the `registration` flow

+ Replace `Registration User Creation` with `Registration Phone User Creation`

+ (Optional) Click on settings for `Registration Phone User Creation` to configure it

+ (Optional) To enable phone verification, click on `Registration with phone registration Form` >`Add` `Phone validation` if you want to verify phone.

+ (Optional) Read query parameter add to user attribute:  
  Click on `Registration with phone registration Form` > `Actions` > `Add execution` on the `Query Parameter Reader` line  
  Click on `Registration with phone registration Form` > `Actions` > `configure` add accept param name in to  

+ (Optional) Hidden password field:  
  Delete or disable `Password Validation`.

+ (Optional) if not any user profile:  
  Delete or disable `Profile Validation`

Set all added items as `Required`.

On the `Authentication` page, bind `Registration with phone` to `Registration flow`

Under `Realm Settings` > `Themes`
Set `Login Theme` to `phone`

Tip:
  If Realm parameter `Email as username` is true, then config `Phone number as username` and `hide email` is invalid!  
  If parameter `duplicate-phone` is true then `Phone number as username` is invalid!

Registration URL:
```
http://<domain>/realms/<realm name>/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=<client id>&response_type=code&scope=openid%20email&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
```
### **Login by phone**
Under `Authentication` > `Flows`:
+ Copy the `Browser` flow to `Browser with phone` flow
+ Replace `Username Password Form` with `Phone Username Password Form`
+ Click on the settings icon next to `Phone Username Password Form` to configure.

Under `Realm Settings` > `Themes`
Set Login Theme as `phone`

Set Bind `Browser with phone` to `Browser flow`
On the `Authentication` page, bind `Browser with phone` to `Browser flow`

![Login By phone](https://github.com/cooper-lyt/keycloak-phone-provider/raw/master/examples/document/e0.jpg)


### **OTP by Phone**

Two user attributes are going to be used by this provider: `phoneNumberVerified` (bool) and `phoneNumber` (str). Multiple
users can have the same `phoneNumber`, but only one of them will have `phoneNumberVerified` = `true` at the end of a
verification process. This accommodates the use case of pre-paid numbers that get recycled if inactive for too much time.


  On Authentication page, copy the browser flow and replace `OTP` with  `OTP Over SMS` . Don't forget to bind this flow copy as the de facto browser flow.
  Finally, register the required actions `Update Phone Number` and `Configure OTP over SMS` in the Required Actions tab.

![OTP](https://github.com/cooper-lyt/keycloak-phone-provider/raw/master/examples/document/b0.jpg)

### **Only use phone login or get Access token use endpoints:**

Under `Authentication` > `Flows`:
 + Copy the `Direct Grant` flow to `Direct grant with phone` flow
 + Click on `Add step` on the `Provide Phone Number` line
 + Click on `Add step` on the `Provide Verification Code` line
 + Delete or disable other
 + Set both of `Provide Phone Number` and `Provide Verification Code` to `REQUIRED`

Under `Clients` > `$YOUR_CLIENT` > `Advanced ` > `Authentication Flow Overrides`
Bind `Direct Grant Flow` to `Direct grant with phone`

![Setting](https://github.com/cooper-lyt/keycloak-phone-provider/raw/master/examples/document/c0.jpg)

### **Everybody phone number( if not exists create user by phone number) get Access token use endpoints:**

Under `Authentication` > `Flows`:
 + Copy the `Direct Grant` flow to `Direct grant everybody with phone` flow
 + Click on `Actions` > `Add step` on the `Authentication Everybody By Phone` line and move to first
 + Delete or disable other
 + Set `Authentication Everybody By Phone` to `REQUIRED`

Under `Clients` > `$YOUR_CLIENT` > `Advanced` > `Authentication Flow Overrides`
Set Direct Grant Flow to `Direct grant everybody with phone`

**About the API endpoints:**

You'll get 2 extra endpoints that are useful to do the verification from a custom application.

+ `GET /realms/{realmName}/sms/verification-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234` (To request a number verification. No auth required.)
+ `POST /realms/{realmName}/sms/verification-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234&code=123456` (To verify the process. User must be authenticated.)

You'll get 2 extra endpoints that are useful to do the access token from a custom application.
+ `GET /realms/{realmName}/sms/authentication-code?phoneNumber=+5534990001234` (To request a number verification. No auth required.)
+ `POST /realms/{realmName}/protocol/openid-connect/token`
  `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  `grant_type=password&phone_number=$PHONE_NUMBER&code=$VERIFICATION_CODE&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRECT`


And then use Verification Code authentication flow with the code to obtain an access code.

**Phone one key login**
  Testing , coming soon!


## Thanks
Some code written is based on existing ones in these two projects: [keycloak-sms-provider](https://github.com/mths0x5f/keycloak-sms-provider)
and [keycloak-phone-authenticator](https://github.com/FX-HAO/keycloak-phone-authenticator). Certainly I would have many problems
coding all those providers blindly. Thank you!
